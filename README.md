# RTOS-Multi-Threading
This repo includes some practice RTOS codes for memory management, scheduling, locks, semaphores, queues, priority inversion, and multicore programming. 
Repo also has an implementation of spin-lock using hardware instruction and Lock-Free Queue for ESP32 Wroom E. There is also a program demonstrating how lock-free algorithms can prevent priority inversion.
